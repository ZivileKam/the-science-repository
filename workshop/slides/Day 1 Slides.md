# Day 1 — Foundations & Setup (repo-based)

## Goal of the day

By the end of Day 1, every participant has **all the software installed** and a
**working fork of this repository** — accounts created, environment restored,
and both outputs rendering. We use the repository itself as the map: each box in
the architecture diagram is a tool we install and understand today.

> Style: **install-along**. Concept slides are interleaved with explicit
> step-by-step install/exercise slides. Slow is fine — the win is that nobody
> leaves with a broken setup.
>
> RStudio is the environment for Days 1–2. VS Code is introduced on Day 3 only.
> Deep R syntax is Day 2. The optional Shiny app is **not** covered.

# Part A — Framing

## Slide 1 — Welcome

**Title:** The Science Repository
**Subtitle:** One repo for your data, your analysis, and your outputs

**On slide:**

```text
Day 1: Install everything + understand the repository
Day 2: Analyse the data in R
Day 3: Reporting, publication, VS Code, and hypercharge your codebase
```

**Speaker note:**
Today is not about writing R. Today is about understanding the *system* — what
each tool does and how they fit together — and getting it all installed. If your
setup works at the end of today, Days 2 and 3 will be smooth.

---

## Slide 2 — The whole system on one picture

**Title:** Every box is a tool we install today

**Visual:** `workshop_info/overall_structure.png`

**On slide:**

```text
Reference management (Zotero) ┐
Programming language (R)      ├─→  RStudio (the GUI)  ─→  Quarto (Publisher) ─→  Website
Documentation (Markdown)      ┘          ↑   ↑                                  └→  Manuscript / Data (OSF)
                                         │   │
Packages + Coding assistants ─→ code ────┘   │
                          GitHub (Version) ──┘
                          renv  (Environment) ┘
```

**Speaker note:**
Keep this diagram visible all day. Every time we install something, point back
to its box. The center is RStudio; everything else feeds into or out of it.

---

## Slide 3 — The mental model of this repository

**Title:** One repo = data + engine + two outputs

**On slide:**

```text
R/        computes   → the analysis engine (setup + reusable functions)
reports/  present    → the recipes you render (webpage + manuscript)
renders/  are results→ the finished website and paper

Change a function in R/ and BOTH outputs update on the next render.
Nothing is copied by hand between them.
```

**Speaker note:**
This is the single most important idea of the repo. `R/` is the source of truth
for the numbers; `reports/` are just different ways to present them; `renders/`
are the built products. We'll see each folder today.

---

## Slide 4 — What lives where

**Title:** A quick tour of the folders

**On slide:**

```text
R/           analysis engine: 01_setup.R + functions/
data/        mock/ (committed)  ·  raw/ & processed/ (private, gitignored)
reports/     webpage/  ·  manuscript/   (the things you render)
renders/     webpage/  ·  manuscript/   (the rendered outputs)
references/  references.bib  (shared by website + manuscript)
renv/        pinned package versions (renv.lock)
.claude/     rules that stop AI tools from reading your raw data
```

**Speaker note:**
Each folder has its own README. The top-level README is the front door. We are
*not* memorising this — we're building intuition for where things belong.

---

# Part B — GitHub first

## Slide 5 — What is Git and GitHub?

**Title:** Version control: the safety net

**On slide:**

```text
Git    = tracks the history of changes in a project folder
GitHub = hosts that project online, so you can share and collaborate

A repository ("repo") = a project folder + its full change history
```

**Speaker note:**
GitHub is not just a cloud drive. It remembers *every* version, who changed
what, and lets several people work on the same project without overwriting each
other. That history is what makes research auditable.

---

## Slide 6 — GitHub vocabulary

**Title:** The words you'll hear all day

**On slide:**

```text
Fork    Make your own copy of someone else's repo on GitHub
Clone   Download a repo to your computer
Commit  Save a labelled snapshot of your changes
Push    Send your commits up to GitHub
Pull    Bring GitHub's changes down to your computer
Branch  A separate line of work
Merge   Combine work from different branches
```

**Speaker note:**
Don't worry about memorising. Today you'll *fork* once, then *commit* and *push*
small changes. Branches and merges become real on Day 2 when you collaborate in
pairs.

---

## Slide 7 — EXERCISE: create a GitHub account

**Title:** Step 1 — get an account

**On slide:**

```text
1. Go to  github.com
2. Sign up (use an email you'll keep — ideally your university email)
3. Verify your email
4. Pick a username you're happy to share publicly
```

**Check:**

```text
Can you log in and see your (empty) GitHub dashboard?
```

**Speaker note:**
If anyone already has an account, great — just log in. Public usernames will
appear in their website URL later, so pick something sensible.

---

## Slide 8 — EXERCISE: fork the repository

**Title:** Step 2 — make it yours

**On slide:**

```text
1. Open:  github.com/thedataflowcompany/the-science-repository
2. Click  "Fork"  (top right)
3. Keep the name, click "Create fork"
4. You now have:  github.com/<your-awesome-username>/the-science-repository
```

**Key sentence:**

```text
A fork is your own independent copy. You can change it freely
without touching the original.
```

**Speaker note:**
Everyone now owns a complete copy of the template — data, engine, and outputs.
This is the starting point for the whole three days.

---

## Slide 9 — EXERCISE: turn on your website

**Title:** Step 3 — publish your analysis website

**On slide:**

```text
In YOUR fork on GitHub:
1. Settings → Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: main   ·   Folder: / (root)   → Save
4. Wait ~1 minute, then open:
   https://<your-username>.github.io/the-science-repository/renders/webpage/
```

**Speaker note:**
This is the payoff moment. The website was rendered from the code in the repo,
and GitHub is now serving *your* copy of it. Nobody wrote any HTML — it came from
the analysis.

---

## Slide 10 — EXERCISE: your first commit

**Title:** Step 4 — edit the README link and commit

**On slide:**

```text
The README points to the project's website. Make it point to YOURS.

1. Open README.md on GitHub → click the pencil (edit)
2. Find the website link near the top
3. Replace the URL with your own github.io address (from Slide 9)
4. Scroll down → "Commit changes"
   Message:  "Point website link to my fork"
```

**Speaker note:**
That edit-and-commit you just did *is* a commit and a push, done entirely in the
browser. You've now changed your repo and saved a labelled snapshot of it. This
is the core GitHub loop, in miniature.

---

## Slide 11 — Forks, commits, merges — the picture

**Title:** What just happened, visually

**On slide:**

```text
template repo  ──fork──▶  your repo  ──commit──▶  your repo (new snapshot)
                                          │
                                          └── GitHub Pages rebuilds your site

Later (Day 2): branch ──▶ work ──▶ merge back into main
```

**Speaker note:**
You forked (copied), committed (snapshotted a change), and GitHub republished.
On Day 2 we add branches and merges so two people can work at once. Same loop,
more people.

---

## Slide 12 — What must NEVER go on GitHub

**Title:** Data protection checkpoint

**On slide:**

```text
Usually safe to commit:        Usually NOT safe:
  scripts / code                 real / identifiable participant data
  README & docs                  passwords, tokens, API keys
  mock (synthetic) data          ethics docs with sensitive details
  rendered outputs               anything confidential

Rule of thumb:
  Scripts can be shared.  Raw data usually cannot.
  Outputs depend on whether anyone can be identified.
```

**Speaker note:**
This repo is built to enforce that. The next slide shows how `.gitignore`
protects you automatically.

---

## Slide 13 — How the repo protects you: `.gitignore`

**Title:** Real data can't be committed by accident

**On slide:**

```text
data/mock/        committed     (synthetic, safe — everyone uses this today)
data/raw/         gitignored    (your real data — never leaves your machine)
data/processed/   gitignored    (cleaned data — also stays local)

.gitignore also blocks common data file types everywhere except mock/.
```

**Speaker note:**
For the whole workshop we use the mock dataset, so there's no risk. In your own
projects, `.gitignore` is the seatbelt: raw and processed data simply won't be
pushed, even if you forget.

---

# Part C — R + RStudio

## Slide 14 — R vs RStudio

**Title:** The engine and the cockpit

**On slide:**

```text
R        = the programming language that does the work (the engine)
RStudio  = the environment you work in: write code, see data,
           run scripts, view plots, manage the project (the cockpit)

You can run R without RStudio — but RStudio makes everything visible.
```

**Speaker note:**
They are two separate installs. We install both. We are *not* learning R syntax
today — that's Day 2. Today we just need it working.

---

## Slide 15 — EXERCISE: install R and RStudio

**Title:** Step 5 — install the software

**On slide:**

```text
1. Install R:        cran.r-project.org   (pick your OS, latest version)
2. Install RStudio:  posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop  (free Desktop)
3. Open RStudio — it finds R automatically
```

**Check:**

```text
Does RStudio open without errors?
In the Console, type 1 + 1 and press Enter → you should see [1] 2
```

**Speaker note:**
Install R *first*, then RStudio. Windows and Mac differ slightly on the CRAN
page — point to the right link. This is where setup problems surface, so go
slowly and help neighbours.

---

## Slide 16 — EXERCISE: get the repo onto your laptop

**Title:** Step 6 — clone your fork

**On slide:**

```text
Easiest in RStudio:
  File → New Project → Version Control → Git
  Repository URL: https://github.com/<your-username>/the-science-repository
  → Create Project

This downloads YOUR fork and opens it as an RStudio Project.
```

**Speaker note:**
Cloning = downloading your GitHub copy to your machine, with its history
attached. RStudio can do it through menus, no command line needed.

---

## Slide 17 — Open the project, not the files

**Title:** Always open via the .Rproj

**On slide:**

```text
the-science-repository.Rproj   ← double-click THIS

Opening the project (not single files) tells R:
  - where the project root is
  - where data, scripts, and outputs live
  → file paths work the same on everyone's computer
```

**Speaker note:**
The number-one beginner trap is "R can't find my file". Opening the project
fixes most of it, because paths are anchored to the project root, not your
Desktop.

---

## Slide 18 — RStudio in 60 seconds

**Title:** The four panes

**On slide:**

```text
Source       where you write and save scripts
Console      where R runs commands
Environment  the objects currently in memory
Files/Plots/Packages/Help   manage files, see figures, read docs
```

**Speaker note:**
That's all you need today. We'll live in these panes properly on Day 2. For now,
just know where the Console is — we'll type one command into it next.

---

# Part D — Environment control (renv)

## Slide 19 — The "works on my machine" problem

**Title:** Why pinning package versions matters

**On slide:**

```text
Same code + different package versions = different (or broken) results.

"It works on my laptop but not yours."
"It worked last year but not today."
```

**Speaker note:**
Reproducibility isn't only about your code — it's also about the exact versions
of the tools your code depends on. This repo solves that with `renv`.

---

## Slide 20 — What renv does

**Title:** renv = a locked, per-project package library

**On slide:**

```text
renv.lock     records the exact version of every package this project uses
renv/         a private package library just for this project
.Rprofile     activates renv automatically when the project opens

→ Everyone restores the SAME versions. No more version drift.
```

**Speaker note:**
`renv` is the "Environment Control" box in the diagram. Each project gets its own
isolated set of packages, described precisely in `renv.lock`.

---

## Slide 21 — EXERCISE: restore the environment

**Title:** Step 7 — install the exact packages

**On slide:**

```r
install.packages("renv")   # only if RStudio doesn't prompt you
renv::restore()            # installs every package at the pinned version
```

**Check:**

```text
renv reads renv.lock and installs what's missing.
This can take a few minutes — that's normal.
When it finishes, you have every package the project needs.
```

**Speaker note:**
Run this in the Console. It may ask to proceed — say yes. This is the moment
everyone's environment becomes identical. Later, after adding a package, you'd
run `renv::snapshot()` to record it — but not today.

---

# Part E — Documentation & data

## Slide 22 — README: the front door

**Title:** Every project explains itself

**On slide:**

```text
The top-level README tells you:
  - what the project is
  - what lives in each folder
  - how to set up and render

Every folder also has its OWN README (R/, data/, reports/, renders/...).
```

**Speaker note:**
If you open this project in six months, the README gets you back in. When you
fork for your own work, you rewrite the README first.

---

## Slide 23 — Markdown, lightly

**Title:** READMEs are written in Markdown

**On slide:**

```text
# Heading            **bold**        *italic*
- bullet             [link](url)     `code`

Plain text + a few symbols → clean, readable docs.
It's the "Documentation" box in the diagram.
```

**Speaker note:**
You already used Markdown when you edited the README on GitHub. It's deliberately
simple — the same syntax shows up in Quarto later today.

---

## Slide 24 — Mock vs real data: `.Renviron`

**Title:** Step 8 — choose your data mode

**On slide:**

```bash
cp .Renviron.example .Renviron      # make your own local copy
```

```text
Inside .Renviron:
  DATA_MODE=mock   → uses the safe synthetic dataset (default, today)
  DATA_MODE=real   → uses your private raw data (your own projects only)
```

**Speaker note:**
`.Renviron` is local and gitignored — it never gets committed. Today everyone
stays on `mock`. The same code runs on real data later just by flipping this
switch, with no code changes.

---

## Slide 25 — The three data buckets

**Title:** raw → processed → mock

**On slide:**

```text
data/raw/        original data, exactly as received — never hand-edited (private)
data/processed/  cleaned, analysis-ready — created BY scripts, can be rebuilt (private)
data/mock/       synthetic stand-in — committed, safe to share, used in the workshop
```

**Speaker note:**
Raw is input you never touch. Processed is output a script creates. Mock is the
public, synthetic version that lets us all run the same examples safely.

---

# Part F — Reference management (Zotero)

## Slide 26 — Zotero and citations

**Title:** Manage references once, cite everywhere

**On slide:**

```text
Zotero      collects your papers and generates citations
   │  export
   ▼
references/references.bib      ONE shared bibliography
   │
   ├──▶ used by the website
   └──▶ used by the manuscript
```

**Speaker note:**
This is the "Reference management" box. You keep your library in Zotero, export a
`.bib` file into the repo, and *both* outputs cite from the same source. Change a
reference once, it updates everywhere.

---

# Part G — Publisher (Quarto) & outputs

## Slide 27 — What is Quarto?

**Title:** Quarto = prose + code → polished output

**On slide:**

```text
A .qmd file mixes:
  - text (Markdown)
  - R code chunks
  - the results those chunks produce (tables, figures, numbers)

Quarto runs the code and weaves results into the finished document.
```

**Speaker note:**
Quarto is the "Publisher" box. The key idea: your figures and tables are *not*
pasted in — they're generated when the document renders, straight from the `R/`
engine. No copy-paste, no stale numbers.

---

## Slide 28 — Code runs top to bottom

**Title:** A report is a recipe, read in order

**On slide:**

```text
reports/webpage/
  01-data-preparation.qmd   load + clean the data
  02-descriptives.qmd       summarise it
  03-analysis.qmd           model it

Each page runs top → bottom. Setup first, results last.
They all call the shared functions in  R/functions/.
```

**Speaker note:**
This ordering — prepare, describe, analyse — is the backbone of the whole
analysis, and the same order you'll work in on Day 2. Code always executes from
the top down; nothing later works if something earlier failed.

---

## Slide 29 — Two outputs from one engine

**Title:** Website and manuscript, same numbers

**On slide:**

```text
reports/webpage/      ──quarto render──▶  renders/webpage/      (HTML website)
reports/manuscript/   ──quarto render──▶  renders/manuscript/   (LaTeX → PDF paper)

Both reuse R/. Same data, same functions, two presentations.
```

**Speaker note:**
A website needs clickable HTML tables; a journal needs LaTeX. The repo formats
the same results two ways. This is the right-hand side of the diagram: Report
Output.

---

## Slide 30 — EXERCISE: render the website

**Title:** Step 9 — build the site locally

**On slide:**

```bash
quarto render reports/webpage
```

```text
→ rebuilds renders/webpage/
Open renders/webpage/index.html to see it.
(Quarto ships inside RStudio — no separate install needed.)
```

**Speaker note:**
This is the same render that GitHub ran for your Pages site. Now you can do it on
your own laptop and preview before pushing. If it builds, your R + renv + Quarto
chain is fully working — that's the Day 1 finish line.

---

## Slide 31 — The manuscript and Overleaf

**Title:** The paper, and how co-authors join in

**On slide:**

```text
quarto render reports/manuscript
  → generates the data-driven parts (methods, results, figures, tables)
  → assembled by renders/manuscript/main.tex into manuscript.pdf

Overleaf:
  the self-contained renders/manuscript/ folder can sync to Overleaf
  → online, collaborative LaTeX writing with co-authors
```

**Speaker note:**
You don't need Overleaf today. The point is that the manuscript folder is
self-contained, so it can live on Overleaf for co-authoring while the data-driven
parts still come from your R code. We go deeper on Day 3.

---

# Part H — Wrap-up

## Slide 32 — A word on AI assistants

**Title:** Coding assistants — helpful, with guardrails

**On slide:**

```text
AI can help: explain code, draft README text, debug errors.

This repo guards your data:
  .claude/settings.json          blocks AI tools from reading raw/processed data
  *.llm.code-workspace           hides private data from the editor

Rule: AI supports the workflow — it does not receive confidential data.
```

**Speaker note:**
Light touch today — the "Coding assistants" box exists and the repo is built to
keep raw data away from AI tools. We cover responsible AI use properly on Day 3.

---

## Slide 33 — What we deliberately skipped

**Title:** Not today

**On slide:**

```text
Deep R syntax        → Day 2 (objects, functions, dataframes, modelling)
VS Code              → Day 3 (RStudio is our environment for now)
The Shiny app        → optional, not part of this workshop
```

**Speaker note:**
Keeping scope tight is intentional. If your setup works, you're exactly where you
need to be.

---

## Slide 34 — End-of-Day-1 checklist

**Title:** Before you leave today

**On slide:**

```text
[ ] GitHub account created
[ ] Repository forked to your account
[ ] GitHub Pages on → your website loads
[ ] First commit made (README link points to your site)
[ ] R and RStudio installed
[ ] Fork cloned and opened via the .Rproj
[ ] renv::restore() finished successfully
[ ] .Renviron copied (DATA_MODE=mock)
[ ] quarto render reports/webpage works locally
```

**Speaker note:**
Run through this as an exit check. Anyone with unticked boxes should grab the
optional support session — Day 2 assumes all of this works.

---

## Slide 35 — Tomorrow

**Title:** Day 2 — analyse the data in R

**On slide:**

```text
With the scaffold in place, tomorrow we:
  - work inside R/ and the report pages
  - import, clean, and inspect the data
  - build descriptives, figures, and models
  - use branches and merges to collaborate in pairs
```

**Speaker note:**
Everything we installed today becomes the workbench for Day 2. The structure you
set up is what makes the analysis easy to follow and easy to share.
